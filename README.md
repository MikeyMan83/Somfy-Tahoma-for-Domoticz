Somfy Tahoma for Domoticz

Let me start by saying i've got no programming experiance at all. 
First steps towards using API's.

Used the description at:
https://github.com/Somfy-Developer/Somfy-TaHoma-Developer-Mode

To start with Postman to get the API's running and a token received. 
Then imported the swagger API's and imported that to Postman
Both can be found at:
https://www.postman.com/descent-module-geologist-46261774/workspace/somfy-api-s/overview

Now trying to get the API calls to run from Python script.

Again; i'm absolutely rubbish with code. So hoping someone will help out here.


Also taking some inspiration from the Home Assistant plugin:
